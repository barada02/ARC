# ARC Data Exploration Plan

## 1. Data Loading and Basic Inspection

### 1.1 Create a Basic Data Loader
- Set up Python environment with necessary libraries (numpy, matplotlib, etc.)
- Load JSON files into Python data structures
- Verify dataset integrity and size
- Count number of tasks in training, evaluation, and test sets

### 1.2 Basic Statistics
- Calculate statistics across all tasks:
  - Number of training examples per task
  - Distribution of grid sizes (height, width)
  - Distribution of symbols used
  - Input-to-output size relationships

## 2. Visualization Framework

### 2.1 Grid Visualization Functions
- Create functions to visualize grids with proper coloring
- Build side-by-side views of input-output pairs
- Implement interactive navigation between tasks

### 2.2 Task Viewer
- Build a viewer to browse through tasks with:
  - All training examples shown with inputs and outputs
  - Test input display
  - Navigation controls

## 3. Pattern Analysis

### 3.1 Transformation Analysis
- For each task, analyze relationships between inputs and outputs:
  - Size transformations (same, larger, smaller)
  - Color/symbol transformations
  - Structural transformations (rotations, reflections, etc.)
  - Pattern insertions or deletions

### 3.2 Pattern Categorization
- Develop a taxonomy of pattern types:
  - Geometrical transformations
  - Logical operations
  - Pattern repetition or extension
  - Object manipulations
- Classify tasks according to this taxonomy

### 3.3 Difficulty Estimation
- Develop metrics to estimate task difficulty
- Analyze which pattern types are more challenging
- Identify tasks that might require multiple reasoning steps

## 4. Feature Extraction

### 4.1 Basic Grid Features
- Extract features like:
  - Grid dimensions
  - Symbol/color counts and distributions
  - Connected components
  - Lines and shapes

### 4.2 Relational Features
- Identify relationships between elements:
  - Adjacency patterns
  - Symmetry properties
  - Spatial relationships
  - Recursive patterns

### 4.3 Transformation Features
- Calculate features that capture transformations:
  - Input-output size ratios
  - Symbol mapping matrices
  - Structural change metrics

## 5. Baseline Approaches

### 5.1 Rule-Based Transformations
- Implement basic transformations:
  - Rotations, flips, shifts
  - Color/symbol mappings
  - Simple shape operations
- Test these on the training set

### 5.2 Pattern Matching
- Develop algorithms to match patterns in grids
- Create template-matching approaches
- Test their performance on simple task types

### 5.3 Simple Neural Baselines

- Include features for searching by pattern type
- Allow annotation and tagging of tasks

### 7.2 Solution Explorer
- Create a tool to test and visualize solution attempts
- Allow manual creation of solutions to build intuition
- Compare human-generated solutions with algorithmic ones

## 8. Systematic Documentation

### 8.1 Pattern Catalog
- Document identified patterns with examples
- Create a reference guide for different transformation types
- Include human-readable descriptions of patterns

### 8.2 Task Difficulty Index
- Create an index of tasks by estimated difficulty
- Document which reasoning capabilities are needed for each
- Group similar tasks for focused study

## 9. Implementation Plan

### 9.1 Core Components
- Based on exploration, identify key components needed:
  - Grid representation library
  - Transformation detection modules
  - Pattern recognition algorithms
  - Search and reasoning frameworks

### 9.2 Development Roadmap
