# Implementation Toolkit: Core Components for Abstract Reasoning

This document outlines the essential components to build for an abstract reasoning system. Rather than competition-specific code, these are general-purpose tools that will develop your skills and intuition.

## 1. Grid Representation Framework

### Core Components
- **Grid class** with methods for:
  - Basic manipulations (rotate, flip, crop, etc.)
  - Feature extraction (counts, patterns, symmetries)
  - Comparison operations (equality, similarity metrics)
  - Serialization/deserialization

```python
class Grid:
    def __init__(self, data=None, height=0, width=0):
        # Initialize grid from data or dimensions
        pass
        
    def rotate(self, degrees=90):
        # Rotate grid by specified degrees
        pass
    
    def flip(self, axis="horizontal"):
        # Flip grid along specified axis
        pass
    
    def crop(self, top, left, height, width):
        # Extract subgrid
        pass
