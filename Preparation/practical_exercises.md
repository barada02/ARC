# Practical Exercises for Abstract Reasoning Skills

This document contains hands-on exercises to develop your abstract reasoning capabilities, organized by skill area. Each exercise builds intuition and practical experience that transfers to solving ARC-like problems.

## 1. Pattern Recognition Exercises

### Exercise 1.1: Grid Transformations
1. Create a 5x5 grid with a simple pattern (like a diagonal line)
2. Apply the following transformations and observe the results:
   - Rotation (90째, 180째, 270째)
   - Reflection (horizontal, vertical)
   - Inversion (swap colors/values)
3. Create a function to detect which transformation was applied between two grids

### Exercise 1.2: Pattern Completion
1. Create sequences of patterns with increasing complexity:
   - Simple progression (adding one element each step)
   - Alternating patterns (ABAB or ABCABC)
   - Nested patterns (patterns within patterns)
2. Remove the final element and practice predicting it
3. Analyze your reasoning process: what rules did you identify?

### Exercise 1.3: Rule Extraction
1. Create 3-4 input/output pairs following a specific rule (like "rotate objects by 45째 and change color")
2. Give only the input/output pairs (not the rule) to a colleague/friend
3. Ask them to describe the rule and predict a new output
4. Compare their reasoning process with yours

## 2. Algorithmic Thinking Exercises

### Exercise 2.1: Rule Formalization
1. Look at everyday patterns (tile arrangements, traffic signals, etc.)
2. Write formal rules that describe these patterns
3. Test your rules by applying them to new instances
4. Refine the rules to handle edge cases

### Exercise 2.2: Minimal Representation
1. Take a complex visual pattern
2. Determine the minimal set of rules needed to reproduce it
3. Implement these rules in code to generate the pattern
4. Challenge: reduce your rule set even further without losing fidelity

### Exercise 2.3: Program Synthesis by Hand
1. Create simple transformation problems (e.g., sort grid elements, group by color)
2. Write pseudocode that solves each problem
3. Test your algorithm on variations of the problem
4. Optimize your solution for clarity and generalization

## 3. Abstraction Exercises

### Exercise 3.1: Concept Hierarchy
1. Identify objects in a visual scene
2. Organize them into a hierarchy from concrete to abstract
3. Define the properties that distinguish each level
4. Practice inferring higher-level concepts from lower-level features

### Exercise 3.2: Analogical Reasoning
1. Create your own "A is to B as C is to ?" problems using visual patterns
2. Solve analogies by identifying the transformation between A and B
3. Apply the same transformation to C
4. Challenge: create analogies that require multiple transformation steps

### Exercise 3.3: Feature Extraction
1. Collect diverse visual puzzles (from magazines, books, etc.)
2. For each puzzle, list all potentially relevant features
3. Identify which features were actually needed to solve the puzzle
4. Create a "feature importance" framework for different puzzle types

## 4. Meta-Learning Exercises

### Exercise 4.1: Strategy Selection
1. Collect 10-15 different types of puzzles
2. Solve each one, documenting your approach
3. Classify the strategies you used
4. Create a decision tree for selecting strategies based on puzzle characteristics

### Exercise 4.2: Transfer Learning Practice
1. Master a specific puzzle type (e.g., Sudoku)
2. Attempt a related but different puzzle (e.g., Kakuro)
3. Explicitly identify which skills transfer between the puzzles
4. Develop a generalized approach that works for both

### Exercise 4.3: Few-Shot Learning Simulation
1. Create a new type of puzzle with its own rules
2. Provide only 2-3 examples of solved instances
3. Challenge yourself to infer the rules and solve new instances
4. Reflect on your inference process

## 5. Implementation Exercises

### Exercise 5.1: Visual Reasoning Library
1. Create a small code library for grid manipulations:
   - Functions for rotation, reflection, etc.
   - Pattern detection algorithms
   - Distance metrics between patterns
2. Test your library on increasingly complex patterns

### Exercise 5.2: Rule Induction System
1. Implement a simple rule induction system that:
   - Takes input/output pairs
   - Generates possible transformation rules
   - Tests rules against examples
   - Returns the simplest valid rule
2. Test on simple problems first, then increase complexity

### Exercise 5.3: Search-Based Problem Solver
1. Implement a search algorithm that:
   - Explores possible transformations
   - Evaluates how close each result is to the target
   - Uses heuristics to guide the search
2. Apply it to progressively harder transformation problems
