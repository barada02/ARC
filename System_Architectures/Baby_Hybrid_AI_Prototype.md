- **Compositional Learning**: Build complex behaviors from simple primitives

### **Technical Approach**
- **Neural-Symbolic Hybrid**: Combine continuous neural representations with discrete symbolic operations
- **Memory-Augmented**: External memory for storing and retrieving successful patterns
- **Program Synthesis**: Generate sequences of primitive operations

## 🧩 Core Components

### **1. Encoder (E) - "Visual Cortex"**

**Purpose**: Convert raw integer grids into rich feature representations

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Input Grid 0-9"] --> B["One-Hot Encoding
    or Embedding"]
    B --> C["CNN Layers
    or Patch MLP"]
    C --> D["Feature Map
    H×W×D"]
    D --> E["Global Summary
    via Pooling"]
    
    style D fill:#e1f5fe
```

**Implementation Options**:
- **CNN Approach**: Small convolutional layers to detect local patterns
- **Patch-based MLP**: Treat each cell/patch as token, use MLP mixing
- **Hybrid**: CNN for local features + attention for global patterns

**Key Features**:
- Input: Integer matrices (typically 3×3 to 30×30)
- Encoding: One-hot vectors (10D for colors 0-9) or learned embeddings
- Output: Dense feature map preserving spatial structure
- Learns: Color patterns, spatial relationships, basic shapes

**Architecture Details**:
```python
class Encoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim=10, hidden_dim=64, num_layers=3):
        # One-hot encoding or embedding layer
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(10, input_dim)  
        
        # CNN layers for spatial processing
        self.conv_layers = nn.ModuleList([
            nn.Conv2d(input_dim, hidden_dim, 3, padding=1),
            nn.Conv2d(hidden_dim, hidden_dim, 3, padding=1),
            nn.Conv2d(hidden_dim, hidden_dim, 3, padding=1)
        ])
        
        # Global context extraction
        self.global_pool = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1)
```

### **2. ProtoMemory (M) - "Episodic Memory"**

**Purpose**: Store and retrieve successful pattern-action associations

    G["Successful Solution"] --> H["Store Pattern-Program
    Pair in Memory"]
    
    style C fill:#f3e5f5
    style H fill:#f3e5f5
```

**Memory Structure**:
- **Keys**: Encoded pattern representations (embeddings from Encoder)
- **Values**: Successful programs/transformations that worked for similar patterns
- **Retrieval**: Cosine similarity or learned metric for nearest neighbor search
- **Storage**: Fixed-size buffer with replacement policy (e.g., least recently used)

**Key Operations**:
```python
class ProtoMemory:
    def store(self, pattern_key, successful_program):
        # Add new pattern-program association
        
    def retrieve(self, query_pattern, k=5):
        # Find k most similar stored patterns
        # Return associated programs as hints
        
    def update(self, pattern_key, program, success_score):
        # Update existing entries based on performance
```

**Memory Benefits**:
