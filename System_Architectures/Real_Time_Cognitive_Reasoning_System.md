# üß† Real-Time Cognitive Reasoning System for ARC Tasks

## Overview

This document presents a **Bayesian-inspired cognitive reasoning system** that mimics human problem-solving for ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) matrix tasks. Unlike traditional neural networks that memorize patterns, this system performs real-time reasoning by extracting rules from examples and applying them to novel test cases.

## Core Philosophy

### **Key Principles**
- **Task Isolation**: Each ARC task has unique transformation rules - no cross-task rule transfer
- **Real-time Learning**: System analyzes examples on-demand, not through pre-training
- **Technique Accumulation**: Stores general pattern detection methods, not specific rules
- **Bayesian Inference**: Updates transformation hypotheses based on evidence from examples
- **Human-like Reasoning**: Mimics how humans approach novel visual reasoning problems

### **Data Constraints**
- Input: Matrices of integers (0-9) representing colors
- Task Structure: Multiple input-output example pairs per task
- Goal: Extract transformation rules and apply to unseen test input
- No pixel data or external knowledge sources

## üîÑ Six-Stage Cognitive Process

### **Stage 1: Observation (Perception Layer)**

**Goal**: Extract structured representations from raw input/output grids

    A[Raw Grid Matrix 0-9] --> B[Color/Number Detection]
    B --> C[Spatial Grouping Techniques]
    C --> D[Position Encoding]
    D --> E[Shape/Boundary Extraction]
    E --> F[Internal Scene Graph]
    
    C --> G[Connected Components]
    C --> H[Color Clustering]
    C --> I[Geometric Patterns]
    
    style F fill:#e1f5fe
```

**Operations**:
- **Grouping**: Detect clusters of similar numbers (colors)
- **Position Encoding**: Record relative positions and spatial relationships
- **Shape Detection**: Identify boundaries, symmetries, geometric patterns
- **Scene Graph**: Convert grid to symbolic representation of objects and relationships

**Output**: Structured internal representation: "Object A at (x1,y1), Object B adjacent to A vertically"

### **Stage 2: Comparison and Analysis (Relational Inference Layer)**

**Goal**: Discover relationships between input and output grid structures

```mermaid

    A[Input Scene Graph] --> C[Correspondence Detection]
    B[Output Scene Graph] --> C
    C --> D[Transformation Analysis]
    D --> E[Pattern Extraction]
    E --> F[Candidate Rule Generation]
    
    style F fill:#f3e5f5
```

**Operations**:
- Compare structural representations between input/output pairs
- Identify which objects/groups correspond across transformation
- Detect transformation types (move, copy, rotate, scale, recolor, etc.)
- Extract recurring patterns across multiple examples

**Output**: Set of potential transformation rules

### **Stage 3: Hypothesis Generation and Testing (Bayesian Inference Layer)**

**Goal**: Find the most probable rule set connecting input ‚Üí output

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Candidate Rules] --> B[Hypothesis Generation]
    B --> C[Mental Simulation]

```
P(hypothesis | examples) ‚àù P(output | hypothesis) √ó P(hypothesis)
```

    style F fill:#fce4ec
```

**Operations**:
- Apply same observation techniques to test input
- Execute highest-probability transformation rules
- Generate predicted output matrix
- Format solution for evaluation

### **Stage 6: Feedback Loop (Error Correction Layer)**

**Goal**: Refine rules based on prediction accuracy

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Predicted Output] --> B[Ground Truth Comparison]
    C[Actual Output] --> B
    B --> D{Error Detected?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Error Analysis]

    E --> G[Rule Refinement]
    G --> H[Re-enter Hypothesis Testing]
    F --> I[Improved Cognitive Ability]
    
    style G fill:#ffebee

## üîç Critical Implementation Questions

### **1. Hypothesis Generation Challenge**

**Problem**: How to generate meaningful transformation hypotheses from limited examples?

**Approaches**:
- **Template-based**: Predefined transformation templates (rotate, copy, fill, etc.)
- **Compositional**: Combine primitive operations into complex transformations

- **Pruning**: Early elimination of inconsistent hypotheses
- **Parallel Testing**: Simultaneous evaluation of multiple candidates

**Research Direction**: Implement beam search with progressive refinement

### **4. Pattern Detection Scope**

- **Count-based**: Repetition, multiplication, aggregation
- **Relational**: Object interactions, conditional transformations

**Research Direction**: Start with spatial + color, expand systematically

### **5. Bayesian Prior Design**

**Problem**: How to set initial hypothesis probabilities?

**Strategies**:
- **Uniform**: Equal probability for all hypotheses
