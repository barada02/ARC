Perfect 👌

Here’s the **second Markdown file** — this one is focused *purely on visualization and structure*, making it ideal for presentation or quick review.
It distills the same architecture into **clear hierarchical Mermaid diagrams**: one for the *macro system view*, one for the *data flow and training loop*, and one for the *modular relationships*.

## 🔄 2. Data Flow & Learning Loop

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Data as Input Grid
    participant Enc as Encoder (E)
    participant Mem as ProtoMemory (M)
    participant Ctrl as Controller (C)
    participant Prim as Primitives (P₁…Pₙ)
    participant Out as Output Grid
    participant Loss as Loss Engine

    Data->>Enc: Encode grid (H×W×D)
    Enc->>Mem: Retrieve nearest prototypes
    Mem->>Ctrl: Provide hints (past programs/patterns)
    Ctrl->>Prim: Generate primitive sequence + args
    Prim->>Out: Execute program to predict grid
    Out->>Loss: Compare output to target grid
    Loss->>Enc: Backpropagate gradients
    Loss->>Ctrl: Update program generation
    Loss->>Prim: Update primitive modules
    Loss->>Mem: Update memory with new embeddings
```

## 🧩 3. Internal Modular Structure

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Encoder {
        +embed(grid)
        +extract_features()
    }

    class ProtoMemory {
        +store(key, value)
        +retrieve(embedding)
    }

    class Controller {
        +generate_program(embedding, prototypes)
        +sequence_primitives()
    }

    class PrimitiveModule {
        +apply(grid, args)
    }

    class WorldModel {
        +predict_next(grid, action)
    }

    class LossEngine {
        +compute(L_final, L_pred, L_proto)
        +backprop()
    }

    Encoder --> ProtoMemory
    ProtoMemory --> Controller
    Controller --> PrimitiveModule
    PrimitiveModule --> WorldModel
    WorldModel --> LossEngine
    LossEngine --> Encoder
    LossEngine --> Controller
    LossEngine --> PrimitiveModule
```

## 🧠 4. Core Training Objectives

```mermaid
graph LR
    L1[L_final<br>Grid Prediction Loss] --> SUM[Total Loss]
    L2[L_pred<br>World Model Prediction Loss] --> SUM
    L3[L_proto<br>Contrastive/Prototype Loss] --> SUM
    L4[L_reg<br>Regularization] --> SUM
```

[
