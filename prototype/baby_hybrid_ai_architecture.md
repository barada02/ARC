# üß† Baby-Like Hybrid AI Architecture (for Grid/Color-number Task)

## Overview
This document represents the **first proposed architecture** for a baby-inspired hybrid AI system.  
The system is designed for grid-based tasks (like the ARC challenge), where each cell contains an integer (0‚Äì9) representing a color.  
The goal is to build a system that *learns like a baby* ‚Äî through perception, pattern discovery, hypothesis generation, memory, and predictive feedback.

## üß© Components

### 1. **Encoder (E)**

* Converts input grid ‚Üí latent feature map of shape (H√óW√óD).
* Implementation: small CNN or patch-based MLP.
* Inputs are integer grids; one-hot encoded or embedded.
* Learns early ‚Äúvisual‚Äù features (like baby perception).

---

### 2. **ProtoMemory (M)**

* Stores key‚Äìvalue pairs of:

  * **Key:** patch embedding
  * **Value:** corresponding action or program
* Retrieval: nearest-neighbor lookup in embedding space.
* Purpose: supports few-shot generalization and episodic recall.

---

### 3. **Controller (C)**

* Core decision-making unit.
* Receives encoder summary + prototype hints.
* Outputs **program** (sequence of primitives and their arguments).
* Implemented as:

  * Transformer or LSTM controller.
  * Can be trained via imitation (supervised) or reinforcement.

---

### 4. **Primitive Modules (P‚ÇÅ‚Ä¶P‚Çô)**

* Basic, composable grid operations.
* Each primitive acts like a baby‚Äôs ‚Äúmotor action.‚Äù
* Examples:

  * `COPY(region, value)`
  * `FLOOD_FILL(start_cell)`
  * `REPLACE(region, value)`
  * `TRANSLATE(pattern, dx, dy)`
  * `MERGE(regionA, regionB)`
* Can be neural (differentiable masks) or symbolic (explicit functions).

---

### 5. **World Model (W)**

* Predicts what happens when a primitive is applied to the current grid.
* Learns a *forward model*: `(grid, action) ‚Üí next_grid`
* Enables predictive coding and curiosity-driven learning.

---

### 6. **Loss Computation**

Total loss combines multiple objectives:

[
L = L_{final} + \lambda_1 L_{pred} + \lambda_2 L_{proto} + \lambda_3 L_{reg}
]

**Where:**

* `L_final`: cross-entropy per-cell (predicted vs target grid)
* `L_pred`: prediction loss (MSE between predicted next grid and true)
* `L_proto`: contrastive/prototype loss for representation learning
* `L_reg`: regularization term for stability

---

## üßÆ Training Loop (Pseudocode)

```python
for epoch in range(E):
    for (grid, target) in loader:
        z = Encoder(grid)                    # HxWxD
        proto = Memory.retrieve(z)           # K nearest prototypes
        program = Controller(z, proto)       # sequence of primitives + args
        pred_grid = apply_program(grid, program, Primitives)

        L_final = cross_entropy(pred_grid, target)
        L_pred = world_model_loss(...)
        L_proto = contrastive_loss(...)

        loss = L_final + lambda1*L_pred + lambda2*L_proto
        backprop_and_step(loss)

        Memory.update(z, program)            # store new prototype
```

---

## üß† Learning Phases

### **Phase A ‚Äî Perception**

* Train encoder + primitives with reconstruction and contrastive losses.
* Goal: stable low-level representations.

### **Phase B ‚Äî Composition**

* Train controller to compose primitives to match solutions.
* Loss: program imitation or reinforcement reward.

### **Phase C ‚Äî Meta-learning**

* Few-shot adaptation to unseen puzzles.
* Techniques: MAML, ProtoNet-style adaptation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Minimal Working Prototype (Quick Start)

**Goal:** Rapidly test the perception-memory hypothesis.

1. Implement a small **U-Net** ‚Üí predict target grid directly.
2. Add a **prototype memory**:

   * Store patch embeddings + target patches.
   * During inference: retrieve and blend nearest patches.
3. Measure improvement in generalization and few-shot adaptation.

This already demonstrates:

* Perception (via CNN encoder)
* Memory recall (via patch-based retrieval)
* Adaptation (via prototype matching)
